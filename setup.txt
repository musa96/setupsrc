SETUP 1.2
=========

Welcome to my DOS Setup Program. You don't have to do much,
you can change some things in SETUP.C and CONFIG.H and re-compile
them.

SETUP.EXE  - Main Setup Program. 
SETUP.C    - Main Setup Program source code.
CONFIG.C   - Code to link with your game.
CONFIG.H   - Header to have full control over varibles.
MAKEFILE   - Makefile for all programs.
TEST.EXE   - Simple test program.
TEST.C     - Source code for that test program.
DOS4GW.EXE - Extender required for all executables.
SETUP.TXT  - You are reading it.

It is tailered for the test program.

You need OpenWatcom 1.8 to compile Setup.

To compile type:
wmake test.exe to make my test program
wmake setup.exe to make my main setup program

If you get undefined references to clrscr(), add this:

void clrscr(void)
{
        _asm 
        {
                mov ax,0003h
                int 10h
        }    
}

Not too hard? Do whatever you want, but give me some credit somewhere.

Revision History:

15\09\09: Press ESC in a menu will go back to the main menu.
          If you are in the Main menu and you press ESC, it will
          save changes and say "Type <your program name>" depending
          on your modifications.
25\09\09: Changed the PC Speaker sound in the test program. Fixed bug
          where you press any other key than C and Q in the test program,
          it quits. Added a new song when you enter graphics mode. Also
          added both compiling in real-mode and protected-mode. If you 
          want to re-compile in real mode, just uncomment !define 286 
          in the makefile.
